# Digit Classification Model

Welcome to the Digit Classification Model repository! This repository contains a basic On-Device Machine Learning model for classifying handwritten digits. It includes the Jupyter Notebook (`Digit_classification_model.ipynb`) for training the model, the source code for an Android app that integrates the TensorFlow Lite model, and the TensorFlow Lite model itself (`digit_classification_model.tflite`).

## Introduction

The Digit Classification Model is designed to recognize and classify handwritten digits from 0 to 9. It utilizes machine learning techniques to train a model capable of accurately predicting the digit written in an image.

## Features

- **Model Training**: The Jupyter Notebook (`Digit_classification_model.ipynb`) provides a step-by-step guide on how to train the digit classification model using the MNIST dataset.
- **Android App**: The Android app source code allows you to integrate the trained TensorFlow Lite model into a mobile application for real-time digit recognition.
- **TensorFlow Lite Model**: The pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model (`digit_classification_model.tflite`) is included, enabling quick integration and deployment in the Android app.

## Prerequisites

To set up and use the Digit Classification Model, you need the following:

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Android Studio (for building and running the Android app)
- Android device or emulator running Android 7.0 (Nougat) or higher

## Setup and Usage

1. **Model Training**:
   - Open the `Digit_classification_model.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
   - Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the digit classification model using the MNIST dataset.
   - Once trained, save the model as `digit_classification_model.tflite`.

2. **Android App Integration**:
   - Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
   - Open the Android app source code in Android Studio.
   - Copy the `digit_classification_model.tflite` file into the `app/src/main/assets` directory of the Android project.
   - Build and run the Android app on your device or emulator.
