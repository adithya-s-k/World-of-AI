### Potato Disease detection

## GOAL

This project involves using deep learning techniques to develop an algorithm to identify the plant is infected by the disease or not

## DATASET

The data set used in this is -: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village

## DESCRIPTION

I will use image classification using CNN using which a farmer can take a picture it will tell you if the plant has a disease or not

In this I will use CNN model to classify image and detect disease

The CNN model will be designed and trained using the collected dataset.
Once the CNN model is trained, it will be tested using a separate set of images to evaluate its accuracy and performance.


## MODELS USED

In this project i have used CNN model. Because it is very efficient in image classification 

## LIBRARIES NEEDED

<br>Tensorflow</br>
<br>opencv</br>
<br><br>pandas</br>
<br>matplotlib.pyplot</br>
<br>numpy</br>

## ACCURACIES

Accuracies and results of Algorithms used
The accuracy score achieved using CNN is: 98.90 %

## CONCLUSION

Implementing a CNN for potato disease detection aims to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and effectiveness of disease identification and management in potato farming, leading to higher crop productivity and reduced economic losses.
After building the model woe can deploy a Mobile app so that it can be easily accessible to farmers
