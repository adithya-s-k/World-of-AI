### Early Heart Disease Prediction

## GOAL

The main purpose of this Project is to increase the accuracy and to have the most accurate model to predict early heart disease among all the machine learning models.

## DATASET

Data has been used from Kaggle.
You can also refer to other dataset inluding the required attributes.

## DESCRIPTION

The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing. Then, different models will be trained and predictions will be made with different algorithms KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest,SVM,Logistic Regression etc. Variety of Machine Learning algorithms implemented in Python to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.
